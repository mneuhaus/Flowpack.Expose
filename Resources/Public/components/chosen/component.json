Please follow these guidelines when submitting new code.\n\n1. Make all changes in Coffeescript files, **not** JavaScript files.\n2. For feature changes, update both jQuery *and* Prototype versions\n3. Use `npm install -d` to install the correct development dependencies.\n4. Use `cake build` or `cake watch` to generate Chosen's JavaScript file and minified version.\n5. Don't touch the `VERSION` file\n6. Submit a Pull Request using GitHub.\n\n### Using CoffeeScript & Cake\n\nFirst, make sure you have the proper CoffeeScript / Cake set-up in place. We have added a package.json that makes this easy:\n\n```\nnpm install -d\n```\n\nThis will install `coffee-script` and `uglifyjs`.\n\nOnce you're configured, building the JavasScript from the command line is easy:\n\n    cake build                # build Chosen from source\n    cake watch                # watch coffee/ for changes and build Chosen\n    \nIf you're interested, you can find the recipes in Cakefile.\n\n\n### Chosen Credits\n\n- Built by [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/).
